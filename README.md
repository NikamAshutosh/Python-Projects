# Python-Projects
Developed a sophisticated house price prediction model incorporating data pre-processing, feature engineering, and Linear Regression, validated by Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) evaluation.

**Project Workflow:-**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the dataset, identifying patterns, and visualizing relationships between variables.

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

**Feature Engineering:** Creating new features, transforming variables to improve model performance.

**Model Building:** Training and evaluating regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict house prices.

**Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R-squared.

**Deployment and Reporting:** Saving the best-performing model, preparing reports and presentations summarizing findings, insights, and next steps.
